# Malaz App - Apartment Rental & Real Estate Platform 🏠

**Malaz** is a high-performance cross-platform mobile application built with **Flutter**. It serves as a sophisticated bridge between landlords and tenants. This project was developed as a collaborative effort by a team of 5 at Damascus University (2025-2026), implementing modern software engineering standards and professional UI/UX features.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Advanced Search Engine:** Dynamic searching by **Title** or **Landlord's Full Name**.
* **Geolocation & OpenStreetMap:** Real-time access to user's current location via `location` & `geocoding`, with interactive map visualization using `flutter_map`.
* **Multi-Language Support:** Fully localized experience supporting **Arabic, English, French, Russian, and Turkish**.
* **Dynamic Theming:** Seamless switching between **Dark Mode** and **Light Mode**.
* **Smart Booking & Rating:** A complete booking lifecycle (Accept/Reject) with a **Post-Rental Rating System** for user feedback.
* **Full Authentication & Profile:** Secure Sign-up/Login and a comprehensive Profile Management module (Image picking, bio updates, and password security).
* **Real-time Communication:** Instant messaging powered by **Pusher Channels**.
* **Instant Notifications:** Real-time alerts for bookings and messages via **Firebase (FCM)**.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (The Engine)
* **Framework:** Flutter (Dart) using **Clean Architecture**.
* **State Management:** **Bloc/Cubit** (`flutter_bloc`) for reactive an  d predictable state handling.
* **Localization:** Internationalization support for 5 languages.
* **Routing & Navigation:** `go_router` for declarative navigation.
* **Logic & Networking:** `dio` for API calls and `dartz` for Functional Programming.
* **Real-time:** `pusher_channels_flutter` & `firebase_messaging`.

## 👩‍💻 My Core Contributions
As a primary Flutter Developer on this project, I specifically engineered:
* **The Search & Discovery Logic:** Developed the advanced search algorithms and integrated **Current Location** services.
* **Rating & Feedback System:** Built the logic for users to rate properties after completing their rental period.
* **Auth & User Identity:** Developed the entire Authentication cycle and Profile sub-system (supporting secure updates and image uploads).
* **Real-time Engine:** Spearheaded the **Pusher Chat module** and integrated **Firebase FCM** for instant alerts.
* **Collaborative Integration:** Worked within a **Clean Architecture** codebase, ensuring compatibility with multi-language support and theme switching modules.
