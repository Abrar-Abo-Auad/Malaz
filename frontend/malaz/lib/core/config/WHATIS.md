# What's Config Directory?

- The `config` directory is responsible for managing the application's configuration, including theme settings.

## - Theme Directory

This directory contains all the theme-related configurations for the application.

* **Why is that?**
By centralizing the theme configuration, we can easily manage and update the application's appearance from a single location.

* **Example:**
```
MaterialApp -> uses ThemeConfig -> which defines the app's theme
```
